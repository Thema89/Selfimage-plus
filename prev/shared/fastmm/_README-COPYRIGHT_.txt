FastMM MEMORY MANAGER License Notes
-----------------------------------
This is the FastMM (Fast Memory Manager) for Delphi and C++ Builder.  It is
Copyright (C) 2004-2005 Professional Software Development / Pierre le Riche.

This code was originally released under the Mozilla Public License, which
is incompatible with the Gnu General Public License. When asked, Mr. le Riche
very kindly agreed to release FastMM under a dual Mozilla Public License/Lesser
General Public License (LGPL) that would allow projects released under the GPL
to make use of it.

There is some controversy over whether the GPL allows static linking of
library code.  As this code is currently used by linking it statically into
projects that are released under the GPL, to avoid any possible licensing
problems, the LGPL's GPL conversion clause (paragraph 3 of the LGPL) has been
invoked.  Therefore, this copy of FastMM is licensed SOLELY under the terms of
the GNU General Public License.

If you wish to obtain a copy under the original MPL/LGPL terms, please visit:
 http://fastmm.sourceforge.net

While you are free to make changes to this code and release those changes
under the GPL, it is asked that any changes be released under the MPL/LGPG
dual license that FastMM's author uses.  This will allow the changes to be
used by the widest possible audience.
